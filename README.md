###### **Software Engineer | Seeking Entry Level Opportunity | JavaScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, React.js**

Hi everyone, my name is Ally Deeter. I recently became a Software Engineer through an immersive full-stack engineering bootcamp at DigitalCrafts. I previously worked in restaurant/bar management and medical administration.

Through my previous career experience, I developed leadership, communication, and problem-solving skills that I hope to put forward into my future as an engineer. During the bootcamp, I excelled at JavaScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I also developed a strong passion for solving algorithms and critically thinking. I am looking for the opportunity to utilize these technical and interpersonal skills.
